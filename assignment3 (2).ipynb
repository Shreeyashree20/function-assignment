What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n"," - A function is a block of code that is defined and can be called by name. It can exist independently and may or may not operate on an object.\n"," - A method is a function that is associated with an object and typically operates on that object (using self in case of class methods). It is bound to the instance of a class and can access and modify the instance's attributes.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n"," - Parameters are the variables that are defined in the function definition and specify what kind of values the function expects when called.\n"," - Arguments are the actual values or data passed to the function when it is called. They correspond to the function's parameters.\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n"," - A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses:\n","    def my_function(parameter):\n","    return parameter\n"," - The function is called by using its name followed by parentheses:\n","  my_function(value)\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n"," - The return statement is used to send the result of a function back to the caller. When a function is called, it performs its operations and then uses return to pass the result out, effectively ending the function's execution and returning control to the caller.\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n"," - An iterable is any Python object that can be iterated over (i.e., you can use a for loop on it). Examples include lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\n"," - An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and has the methods __iter__() and __next__() to produce values one at a time. An iterator can be exhausted, meaning it can run out of values, whereas an iterable can be used to create multiple iterators.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n"," - Generators are a type of iterable that generate items lazily (i.e., one at a time and only when needed). They are defined using a function with the yield keyword instead of return. When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and it can be resumed later.\n","  - def my_generator():\n","    yield 1\n","    yield 2\n","    yield 3\n","\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n"," - Memory Efficiency: Generators only produce one item at a time, rather than creating and storing an entire list in memory.\n"," - Lazy Evaluation: Values are computed only when requested, which can lead to faster execution when dealing with large datasets.\n"," - Infinite Sequences: Generators can be used to represent infinite sequences without consuming an infinite amount of memory.\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n"," - A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. It is typically used for simple operations or when a short function is needed temporarily, such as in functional programming functions like map(), filter(), or sorted().\n","  - square = lambda x: x * x\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n"," - The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list) and returns an iterator yielding the results. It allows you to perform an operation on each element of a sequence in a concise way.\n","  - result = map(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # [1, 4, 9, 16]\n","\n","10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n"," - map(): Applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator with the results. Example: map(func, iterable).\n"," - reduce(): Applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. It is part of the functools module. Example: reduce(func, iterable).\n"," - filter(): Filters the items in an iterable by applying a function that returns True or False and returns an iterator containing only the items for which the function returned True. Example: filter(func, iterable).\n","\n"," 11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n"," list:[47,11,42,13];\n"," - To understand how the reduce() function works for summing elements of a list, let's break it down step by step, using pen and paper (i.e., manually).\n","\n"," - The given list is: [47, 11, 42, 13]\n","\n","   Steps for Summing Using reduce() Function\n","   a) Import the reduce function from the functools module:\n","   - from functools import reduce\n","   b) Define the function that will be applied to the elements in the list. In this case, we want to sum the elements, so we can define a function as:\n","   - def add(x, y):\n","    return x + y\n","   c) Apply reduce() on the list with the add function:\n","   - result = reduce(add, [47, 11, 42, 13])\n","\n","  Breakdown of the Process\n","  The reduce() function works by taking the first two elements of the list and applying the function, then taking the result of that and applying it with the next element, and so on. So, for our list [47, 11, 42, 13], here’s the step-by-step computation:\n","\n"," Step 1: Apply add on the first two elements: 47 and 11.\n"," 47 + 11 = 58\n","\n"," Step 2: Take the result from Step 1 (58) and apply the add function to the next element (42).\n"," 58 + 42 = 100\n","\n"," Step 3: Take the result from Step 2 (100) and apply the add function to the next element (13).\n"," 100 + 13 = 113\n","\n","- Final Result\n"," - After all the steps, the final result is 113.\n","  So, using reduce(), the sum of the list [47, 11, 42, 13] is 113.\n","\n","\n"," #PRACTICALS QUESTIONS\n"," 1.
